# Spring Boot Learning Sandbox ☕️🚀

> **A "No-Magic" approach to mastering Spring Boot.**

This repository documents my personal journey from Spring Boot basics to advanced architectural patterns. Unlike standard tutorials, this sandbox focuses on understanding the *internals*—moving beyond simple copy-pasting to deep comprehension of the "How" and "Why."

## 🗺️ The Learning Landscape

This project is built as a collection of **Modules**. While they build upon each other, the goal is to create a comprehensive reference for different parts of the Spring ecosystem.

      Architecture & DTOs
      Security & Auth
      Testing & Deployment
```

## 📚 Module Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Web Inputs & Data Binding
*Status: Completed*
Focuses on the REST Controller layer and how Spring maps HTTP requests to Java objects.
*   **Challenge 1:** Query Parameters (`@RequestParam`)
*   **Challenge 2:** Path Variables (`@PathVariable`)
*   **Challenge 3:** JSON Payloads & Jackson (`@RequestBody`)

### 🚧 Phase 2: Data Persistence
*Status: In Preparation*
Focuses on JPA, Hibernate internals, Entity lifecycles, and Database interactions.

### 🔮 Backlog (Planned Modules)
*   **Classic MVC:** Server-side rendering with Thymeleaf.
*   **Architecture:** Separation of concerns, DTO pattern, and Service layers.
*   **Advanced Topics:** Security, Custom Queries, and Performance tuning.
